  It is the art-form which has the most impact on people . People don't remember paintings , poems , or jokes or even lyrics of a song for that matter as 
  much as they remember good movies .People love stories , people love fantasies , and they love it 
  because it gives us an experience that we might never have in real life , people also love stories 
  because they relate to some of them . Relive your past memories , feel what you felt again , 
  we can relate , empathize , sympathize and feel what some penned down characters are feeling on screen.
  Movies also entertain while making a point , they present information which we might not have had before , and that
  stunns us when we watch it happening on screen
